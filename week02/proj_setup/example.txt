For other time, first
    1. Create conda venv using the sirst line command
    2. to get to the venv, write conda avtivate venv/ and conda deactivate to stop it
    3. inside that, install ipyjernek using 
            pip install ipykernel
    4. in requirement.txt, when you want to install it, go first to your venv, the use 
            pip install -r requirement.txt    This will download everything inside without the need to install each manually. But if it is you that createdit, you will use 
            pip freeze > requirement.txt to list all the packages you have installed sofar
